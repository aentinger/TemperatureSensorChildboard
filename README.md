# ðŸ“‚ Description

The LXRobotics Temperature Sensor Childboard offers the possiblity to measure the current temperature with high accuracy. In combination with a Radio Shield a wireless sensor network could be formed for monitoring the temperature in each room of an apartment/house. The thermostat function allows the execution of any action when a preset temperature thresholds is exceeded. For a quick and easy start, an open source Arduino library with sample programs is available.

**Features**

* Temperature range -55 Â°C to +125 Â°C
* Thermostat function
* Usage of I2C - only 2 Arduino pins required
* 8 possible I2C addresses configurable via jumpers
* Can be used with the Radioshield the Childboard Adaptershield
* Arduino Library with example programs is available on GitHub
